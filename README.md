# **Lemonade Legends**

Think your business skills are up to snuff? Try running this lemonade stand for a week and see if you can turn a profit.

# **Background**

Lemonade Legends is a simple game with real world parallels. You start with $20.00, a ramshackle wooden stand, and unbridled optimism. But, the reality of the dog-eat-dog lemonade business soon sets in as you struggle to serve a quality product at an affordable price to a demanding clientele.

# **Functionality and MVP**

Before you open each morning, you buy your ingredients for the day. They are:
* Lemons
* Sugar
* Ice cubes
* Cups

Then, you finalize the details of your offering:
* How much will you charge?
* How many parts lemon, sugar and ice find their way into each pitcher?

These questions and answers are a function of the day's weather forecast. The game give its best prediction of temperature, sunniness and precipitation, so you can make data-based decisions.

Finally, the clock strikes 9 am and you're open for business. Based on your price, the quality of your product and the weather, passersby decide whether they want to snag a cup of lemonade or be on their way.

At close, your remaining ice cubes melt. And, if luck is working against you, your lemons or sugar may spoil as well. Tomorrow is another day.

At the end of Day 7, we'll see if you've made any money along the way.

The game will present an 'About' modal describing these rules when the player first opens the window. In addition, this project will include a production README on the Github repository.
